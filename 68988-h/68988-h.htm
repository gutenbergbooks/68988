<p>As the term approaches its close, I wish to keep my promise
regarding a series of lectures relating to literary life and
work, to be given independently of texts or authorities,
and to represent, as far as possible, the results of practical
experience among the makers of literature in different
countries. The subject for this term will be Reading—apparently,
perhaps, a very simple subject, but really not so
simple as it looks, and much more important than you may
think it. I shall begin this lecture by saying that very few
persons know how to read. Considerable experience with
literature is needed before taste and discrimination can
possibly be acquired; and without these, it is almost impossible
to learn how to read. I say <em>almost</em> impossible; since
there are some rare men who, through a natural inborn
taste, through a kind of inherited literary instinct, are able
to read very well even before reaching the age of twenty-five
years. But these are great exceptions, and I am speaking
of the average.</p>
</div>

<p>For, to read the characters or the letters of the text does
not mean reading in the true sense. You will often find
yourselves reading words or characters automatically, even
pronouncing them quite correctly, while your minds are
occupied with a totally different subject. This mere mechanism
of reading becomes altogether automatic at an
early period of life, and can be performed irrespective of attention.
Neither can I call it reading, to extract the narrative
portion of a text from the rest simply for one’s personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
amusement, or, in other words, to read a book “for the
story.” Yet most of the reading that is done in the world
is done in exactly this way. Thousands and thousands
of books are bought every year, every month, I might even
say every day, by people who do not read at all. They only
think that they read. They buy books just to amuse themselves,
“to kill time,” as they call it; in one hour or two
their eyes have passed over all the pages, and there is left in
their minds a vague idea or two about what they have been
looking at; and this they really believe is reading. Nothing
is more common than to be asked, “Have you read such a
book?” or to hear somebody say, “I have read such and
such a book.” But these persons do not speak seriously.
Out of a thousand persons who say, “I have read this,” or
“I have read that,” there is not one perhaps who is able to
express any opinion worth hearing about what he has been
reading. Many and many a time I hear students say that
they have read certain books; but if I ask them some questions
regarding the book, I find that they are not able to
make any answer, or at best, they will only repeat something
that somebody else has said about what they think
that they have been reading. But this is not peculiar to
students; it is in all countries the way that the great public
devours books. And to conclude this introductory part of
the lecture, I would say that the difference between the
great critic and the common person is chiefly that the great
critic knows how to read, and the common person does not.
No man is really able to read a book who is not able to express
an original opinion regarding the contents of a book.</p>

<p>No doubt you will think that this statement of the case
confuses reading with study. You might say, “When we
read history or philosophy or science, then we do read very
thoroughly, studying all the meanings and bearings of the
text, slowly, and thinking about it. This is hard study.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
But when we read a story or a poem out of class-hour, we
read for amusement. Amusement and study are two different
things.” I am not sure that you all think this; but young
men generally do so think. As a matter of fact, every book
worth reading ought to be read in precisely the same way
that a scientific book is read—not simply for amusement;
and every book worth reading should have the same amount
of value in it that a scientific book has, though the value
may be of a totally different kind. For, after all, the good
book of fiction or romance or poetry is a scientific work; it
has been composed according to the best principles of more
than one science, but especially according to the principles
of the great science of life, the knowledge of human nature.</p>

<p>In regard to foreign books, this is especially true; but the
advice suggested will be harder to follow when we read in a
language which is not our own. Nevertheless, how many
Englishmen do you suppose really read a good book in English?
how many Frenchmen read a great book in their own
tongue? Probably not more than one in two thousand of
those who think that they read. What is more, although
there are now published every year in London upwards of
six thousand books, at no time has there been so little good
reading done by the average public as to-day. Books are
written, sold, and read after a fashion—or rather according
to the fashion. There is a fashion in literature as well as
in everything else; and a particular kind of amusement being
desired by the public, a particular kind of reading is
given to supply the demand. So useless have become to
this public the arts and graces of real literature, the great
thoughts which should belong to a great book, that men
of letters have almost ceased to produce true literature.
When a man can obtain a great deal of money by writing a
book without style or beauty, a mere narrative to amuse,
and knows at the same time that if he should give three,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
five, or ten years to the production of a really good book, he
would probably starve to death, he is forced to be untrue to
the higher duties of his profession. Men happily situated in
regard to money matters might possibly attempt something
great from time to time; but they can hardly get a hearing.
Taste has so much deteriorated within the past few years,
that, as I told you before, style has practically disappeared—and
style means thinking. And this state of things in
England has been largely brought about by bad habits of
reading, by not knowing how to read.</p>

<p>For the first thing which a scholar should bear in mind is
that a book ought not to be read for mere amusement.
Half-educated persons read for amusement, and are not to
be blamed for it; they are incapable of appreciating the
deeper qualities that belong to a really great literature.
But a young man who has passed through a course of university
training should discipline himself at an early day never
to read for mere amusement. And once the habit of the
discipline has been formed, he will even find it impossible to
read for mere amusement. He will then impatiently throw
down any book from which he cannot obtain intellectual
food, any book which does not make an appeal to the higher
emotions and to his intellect. But on the other hand, the
habit of reading for amusement becomes with thousands of
people exactly the same kind of habit as wine-drinking or
opium-smoking; it is like a narcotic, something that helps
to pass the time, something that keeps up a perpetual condition
of dreaming, something that eventually results in destroying
all capacity for thought, giving exercise only to the
surface parts of the mind, and leaving the deeper springs of
feeling and the higher faculties of perception unemployed.</p>

<p>Let us simply state what the facts are about this kind of
reading. A young clerk, for example, reads every day on
the way to his office and on the way back, just to pass the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
time; and what does he read? A novel, of course; it is very
easy work, and it enables him to forget his troubles for a
moment, to dull his mind to all the little worries of his daily
routine. In one day or two days he finishes the novel; then
he gets another. He reads quickly in these days. By the
end of the year he has read between a hundred and fifty and
two hundred novels; no matter how poor he is, this luxury
is possible to him, because of the institution of circulating
libraries. At the end of a few years he has read several thousand
novels. Does he like them? No; he will tell you that
they are nearly all the same, but they help him to pass
away his idle time; they have become a necessity for him;
he would be very unhappy if he could not continue this sort
of reading. It is utterly impossible that the result can be
anything but a stupefying of the faculties. He cannot even
remember the names of twenty or thirty books out of
thousands; much less does he remember what they contain.
The result of all this reading means nothing but a cloudiness
in his mind. That is the direct result. The indirect result is
that the mind has been kept from developing itself. All development
necessarily means some pain; and such reading
as I speak of has been employed unconsciously as a means
to avoid that pain, and the consequence is atrophy.</p>

<p>Of course this is an extreme case; but it is the ultimate
outcome of reading for amusement whenever such amusement
becomes a habit, and when there are means close at
hand to gratify the habit. At present in Japan there is little
danger of this state of things; but I use the illustration
for the sake of its ethical warning.</p>

<p>This does not mean that there is any sort of good literature
which should be shunned. A good novel is just as good
reading as even the greatest philosopher can possibly wish
for. The whole matter depends upon the way of reading,
even more than upon the nature of what is read. Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
it is too much to say, as has often been said, that there is no
book which has nothing good in it; it is better simply to
state that the good of a book depends incomparably more
for its influence upon the habits of the reader than upon the
art of the writer, no matter how great that writer may be.
In a previous lecture I tried to call your attention to the
superiority of the child’s methods of observation to those
of the man; and the same fact may be noticed in regard to
the child’s method of reading. Certainly the child can read
only very simple things; but he reads most thoroughly; and
he thinks and thinks untiringly about what he reads; one
little fairy tale will give him mental occupation for a month
after he has read it. All the energies of his little fancy are
exhausted upon the tale; and if his parents be wise, they do
not allow him to read a second tale, until the pleasure of the
first, and its imaginative effect, has begun to die away.
Later habits, habits which I shall venture to call bad, soon
destroy the child’s power of really attentive reading. But
let us now take the case of a professional reader, a scientific
reader; and we shall observe the same power, developed of
course to an enormous degree. In the office of a great publishing
house which I used to visit, there are received every
year sixteen thousand manuscripts. All these must be
looked at and judged; and such work in all publishing houses
is performed by what are called professional readers. The
professional reader must be a scholar, and a man of very
uncommon capacity. Out of a thousand manuscripts he
will read perhaps not more than one; out of two thousand
he may possibly read three. The others he simply looks at
for a few seconds—one glance is enough for him to decide
whether the manuscript is worth reading or not. The shape
of a single sentence will tell him that, from the literary
point of view. As regards subject, even the title is enough
for him to judge, in a large number of cases. Some manuscripts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
may receive a minute or even five minutes of his attention;
very few receive a longer consideration. Out of
sixteen thousand, we may suppose that sixteen are finally
selected for judgment. He reads these from beginning to
end. Having read them, he decides that only eight can be
further considered. The eight are read a second time, much
more carefully. At the close of the second examination the
number is perhaps reduced to seven. These seven are destined
for a third reading; but the professional reader knows
better than to read them immediately. He leaves them
locked up in a drawer, and passes a whole week without looking
at them. At the end of the week he tries to see whether
he can remember distinctly each of these seven manuscripts
and their qualities. Very distinctly he remembers three;
the remaining four he cannot at once recall. With a little
more effort, he is able to remember two more. But two he
has utterly forgotten. This is a fatal defect; the work that
leaves no impression upon the mind after two readings cannot
have real value. He then takes the manuscripts out of
the drawer, condemns two (those he could not remember),
and re-reads the five. At the third reading everything
is judged—subject, execution, thought, literary quality.
Three are discovered to be first class; two are accepted by
the publishers only as second class. And so the matter ends.</p>

<p>Something like this goes on in all great publishing houses;
but unfortunately not all literary work is now judged in the
same severe way. It is now judged rather by what the public
likes; and the public does not like the best. But you may
be sure that in a house such as that of the Cambridge or the
Oxford University publishers, the test of a manuscript is
very severe indeed; it is there read much more thoroughly
than it is likely ever to be read again. Now this professional
reader whom we speak of, with all his knowledge and scholarship
and experience, reads the book very much in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
same way as the child reads a fairy tale. He has forced his
mind to exert all its powers in the same minute way that the
child’s mind does, to think about everything in the book,
in all its bearings, in a hundred different directions. It is
not true that a child is a bad reader; the habit of bad reading
is only formed much later in life, and is always unnatural.
The natural and also the scholarly way of reading is
the child’s way. But it requires what we are apt to lose as
we grow up, the golden gift of patience; and without patience
nothing, not even reading, can be well done.</p>

<p>Important then as careful reading is, you can readily perceive
that it should not be wasted. The powers of a well-trained
and highly educated mind ought not to be expended
upon any common book. By common I mean cheap and
useless literature. Nothing is so essential to self-training as
the proper choice of books to read; and nothing is so universally
neglected. It is not even right that a person of ability
should waste his time in “finding out” what to read.
He can easily obtain a very correct idea of the limits of the
best in all departments of literature, and keep to that best.
Of course, if he has to become a specialist, a critic, a professional
reader, he will have to read what is bad as well as
what is good, and will be able to save himself from much
torment only by an exceedingly rapid exercise of judgment,
formed by experience. Imagine, for example, the reading
that must have been done, and thoroughly done, by such a
critic as Professor Saintsbury. Leaving out of the question
all his university training, and his mastery of Greek and
Latin classics, which is no small reading to begin with, he
must have read some five thousand books in the English of
all centuries—learned thoroughly everything that was in
them, the history of each one, and the history of its author,
whenever that was accessible. He must also have mastered
thoroughly the social and political history relating to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
this mass of literature. But this is still less than half his
work. For, being an authority upon two literatures, his
study of French, both old and new French, must have been
even more extensive than his study of English. And all his
work had to be read as a master reads; there was little more
amusement in the whole from beginning to end. The only
pleasure could be in results; but these results are very great.
Nothing is more difficult in this world than to read a book
and then to express clearly and truly in a few lines exactly
what the literary value of the book is. There are not more
than twenty people in the world who can do this, for the
experience as well as the capacity required must be enormous.
Very few of us can hope to become even third or
fourth class critics after a lifetime of study. But we can
all learn to read; and that is not by any means a small
feat. The great critics can best show us the way to do
this, by their judgment.</p>

<p>Yet after all, the greatest of critics is the public—not
the public of a day or a generation, but the public of centuries,
the consensus of national opinion or of human opinion
about a book that has been subjected to the awful test
of time. Reputations are made not by critics, but by the
accumulation of human opinion through hundreds of years.
And human opinion is not sharply defined like the opinion
of a trained critic; it cannot explain; it is vague, like a great
emotion of which we cannot exactly describe the nature; it
is based upon feeling rather than upon thinking; it only
says, “we like this.” Yet there is no judgment so sure as
this kind of judgment, for it is the outcome of an enormous
experience. The test of a good book ought always to be the
test which human opinion, working for generations, applies.
And this is very simple.</p>

<p>The test of a great book is whether we want to read it
only once or more than once. Any really great book we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
want to read the second time even more than we wanted
to read it the first time; and every additional time that we
read it we find new meanings and new beauties in it. A
book that a person of education and good taste does not
care to read more than once is very probably not worth
much. Some time ago there was a very clever discussion going
on regarding the art of the great French novelist, Zola;
some people claimed that he possessed absolute genius;
others claimed that he had only talent of a very remarkable
kind. The battle of argument brought out some strange extravagances
of opinion. But suddenly a very great critic
simply put this question: “How many of you have read, or
would care to read, one of Zola’s books a second time?”
There was no answer; the fact was settled. Probably no one
would read a book by Zola more than once; and this is
proof positive that there is no great genius in them, and no
great mastery of the highest form of feeling. Shallow or
false any book must be, that, although bought by a hundred
thousand readers, is never read more than once. But
we cannot consider the judgment of a single individual infallible.
The opinion that makes a book great must be the
opinion of many. For even the greatest critics are apt to
have certain dullnesses, certain inappreciations. Carlyle,
for example, could not endure Browning; Byron could not
endure some of the greatest of English poets. A man must
be many-sided to utter a trustworthy estimate of many
books. We may doubt the judgment of the single critic at
times. But there is no doubt possible in regard to the judgment
of generations. Even if we cannot at once perceive
anything good in a book which has been admired and
praised for hundreds of years, we may be sure that by trying,
by studying it carefully, we shall at last be able to feel
the reason of this admiration and praise. The best of all libraries
for a poor man would be a library entirely composed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
of such great works only, books which have passed the test
of time.</p>

<p>This then would be the most important guide for us in
the choice of reading. We should read only the books that
we want to read more than once, nor should we buy any
others, unless we have some special reason for so investing
money. The second fact demanding attention is the general
character of the value that lies hidden within all such great
books. A great book is not apt to be comprehended by a
young person at the first reading except in a superficial way.
Only the surface, the narrative, is absorbed and enjoyed.
No young man can possibly see at first reading the qualities
of a great book. Remember that it has taken humanity in
many cases hundreds of years to find out all that there is in
such a book. But according to a man’s experience of life,
the text will unfold new meanings to him. The book that
delighted us at eighteen, if it be a good book, will delight us
much more at twenty-five, and it will prove like a new book
to us at thirty years of age. At forty we shall re-read it,
wondering why we never saw how beautiful it was before.
At fifty or sixty years of age the same facts will repeat
themselves. A great book grows exactly in proportion to
the growth of the reader’s mind. It was the discovery of
this extraordinary fact by generations of people long dead
that made the greatness of such works as those of Shakespeare,
of Dante, or of Goethe. Perhaps Goethe can give us
at this moment the best illustration. He wrote a number of
little stories in prose, which children like, because to children
they have all the charm of fairy tales. But he never intended
them for fairy tales; he wrote them for experienced
minds. A young man finds very serious reading in them; a
middle aged man discovers an extraordinary depth in their
least utterance; and an old man will find in them all the
world’s philosophy, all the wisdom of life. If one is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
dull, he may not see much in them, but just in proportion
as he is a superior man, and in proportion as his knowledge
of life has been extensive, so will he discover the greatness
of the mind that conceived them.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the authors of such books could
have preconceived the entire range and depth of that which
they put into their work. Great art works unconsciously
without ever suspecting that it is great; and the larger the
genius of a writer, the less chance there is of his ever knowing
that he has genius; for his power is less likely to be discovered
by the public until long after he is dead. The great
things done in literature have not usually been done by
men who thought themselves great. Many thousand years
ago some wanderer in Arabia, looking at the stars of the
night, and thinking about the relation of man to the unseen
powers that shaped the world, uttered all his heart in certain
verses that have been preserved to us in the Book of
Job. To him the sky was a solid vault; of that which might
exist beyond it, he never even dreamed. Since his time how
vast has been the expansion of our astronomical knowledge!
We now know thirty millions of suns, all of which are probably
attended by planets, giving a probable total of three
hundred millions of other worlds within sight of our astronomical
instruments. Probably multitudes of these are inhabited
by intelligent life; it is even possible that within a
few years more we shall obtain proof positive of the existence
of an older civilization than our own upon the planet
Mars. How vast a difference between our conception of the
universe and Job’s conception of it. Yet the poem of that
simple-minded Arab or Jew has not lost one particle of its
beauty and value because of this difference. Quite the contrary!
With every new astronomical discovery the words of
Job take grander meanings to us, simply because he was
truly a great poet and spoke only the truth that was in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
heart thousands of years ago. Very anciently also there was
a Greek story-teller who wrote a little story about a boy and
girl in the country, called <cite>Daphnis and Chloe</cite>. It was a little
story, telling in the simplest language possible how that boy
and girl fell in love with each other, and did not know why,
and all the innocent things they said to each other, and how
grown-up people kindly laughed at them and taught them
some of the simplest laws of life. What a trifling subject,
some might think. But that story, translated into every
language in the world, still reads like a new story to us; and
every time we re-read it, it appears still more beautiful, because
it teaches a few true and tender things about innocence
and the feeling of youth. It never can grow old, any
more than the girl and boy whom it describes. Or, to descend
to later times, about three hundred years ago a French
priest conceived the idea of writing down the history of a
student who had been charmed by a wanton woman, and
led by her into many scenes of disgrace and pain. This little
book, called <cite>Manon Lescaut</cite>, describes for us the society of a
vanished time, a time when people wore swords and powdered
their hair, a time when everything was as different as
possible from the life of to-day. But the story is just as true
of our own time as of any time in civilization; the pain and
the sorrow affect us just as if they were our own; and the
woman, who is not really bad, but only weak and selfish,
charms the reader almost as much as she charmed her victim,
until the tragedy ends. Here again is one of the world’s
great books that cannot die. Or, to take one more example
out of a possible hundred, consider the stories of Hans Andersen.
He conceived the notion that moral truths and social
philosophy could be better taught through little fairy
tales and child stories than in almost any other way; and
with the help of hundreds of old-fashioned tales, he made a
new series of wonderful stories that have become a part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
every library and are read in all countries by grown-up
people much more than by children. There is in this astonishing
collection of stories, a story about a mermaid, which I
suppose you have all read. Of course there can be no such
thing as a mermaid; from one point of view the story is
quite absurd. But the emotions of unselfishness and love
and loyalty which the story expresses are immortal, and so
beautiful that we forget about all the unreality of the
framework; we see only the eternal truth behind the fable.</p>

<p>You will understand now exactly what I mean by a great
book. What about the choice of books? Some years ago
you will remember that an Englishman of science, Sir John
Lubbock, wrote a list of what he called the best books in
the world—or at least the best hundred books. Then some
publishers published the hundred books in cheap form.
Following the example of Sir John, other literary men made
different lists of what they thought the best hundred books
in existence; and now quite enough time has passed to show
us the value of these experiments. They have proved utterly
worthless, except to the publishers. Many persons
may buy the hundred books; but very few read them. And
this is not because Sir John Lubbock’s idea was bad; it is
because no one man can lay down a definite course of reading
for the great mass of differently constituted minds. Sir
John expressed only his opinion of what most appealed to
him; another man of letters would have made a different
list; probably no two men of letters would have made exactly
the same one. The choice of great books must, under
all circumstances, be an individual one. In short, you must
choose for yourselves according to the light that is in you.
Very few persons are so many-sided as to feel inclined to
give their best attention to many different kinds of literature.
In the average of cases it is better for a man to confine
himself to a small class of subjects—the subjects best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
according with his natural powers and inclinations, the subjects
that please him. And no man can decide for us, without
knowing our personal character and disposition perfectly
well and being in sympathy with it, where our powers
lie. But one thing is easy to do—that is, to decide, first,
what subject in literature has already given you pleasure;
to decide, secondly, what is the best that has been written
upon that subject, and then to study that best to the exclusion
of ephemeral and trifling books which profess to deal
with the same theme, but which have not yet obtained the
approbation of great critics or of a great public opinion.</p>

<p>Those books which have obtained both are not so many in
number as you might suppose. Each great civilization has
produced only two or three of the first rank, if we except the
single civilization of the Greeks. The sacred books embodying
the teaching of all great religions necessarily take place
in the first rank, even as literary productions; for they have
been polished and repolished, and have been given the highest
possible literary perfection of which the language in
which they are written is capable. The great epic poems
which express the ideals of races, these also deserve a first
place. Thirdly, the masterpieces of drama, as reflecting
life, must be considered to belong to the highest literature.
But how many books are thus represented? Not very many.
The best, like diamonds, will never be found in great
quantities.</p>

<p>Besides such general indications as I have thus ventured,
something may be said regarding a few choice books—those
which a student should wish to possess good copies of
and read all his life. There are not many of these. For European
students it would be necessary to name a number of
Greek authors. But without a study of the classic tongues
such authors could be of much less use to the students of
this country; moreover, a considerable knowledge of Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
life and Greek civilization is necessary to quicken appreciation
of them. Such knowledge is best gained through engravings,
pictures, coins, statues—through those artistic
objects which enable the imagination to see what has existed;
and as yet the artistic side of classical study is scarcely
possible in Japan, for want of pictorial and other material.
I shall therefore say very little regarding the great books
that belong to this category. But as the whole foundation
of European literature rests upon classical study, the student
should certainly attempt to master the outlines of
Greek mythology, and the character of the traditions
which inspired the best of Greek literature and drama.
You can scarcely open an English book belonging to any
high class of literature, in which you will not find allusions
to Greek beliefs, Greek stories, or Greek plays. The mythology
is almost necessary for you; but the vast range of the
subject might well deter most of you from attempting a
thorough study of it. A thorough study of it, however, is
not necessary. What is necessary is an outline only; and a
good book, capable of giving you that outline in a vivid
and attractive manner would be of inestimable service. In
French and German there are many such books; in English,
I know of only one, a volume in Bohn’s Library, Keightley’s
<cite>Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy</cite>. It is not an expensive
work; and it has the exceptional quality of teaching in
a philosophical spirit. As for the famous Greek books, the
value of most of them for you must be small, because the
number of adequate translations is small. I should begin by
saying that all verse translations are useless. No verse
translation from the Greek can reproduce the Greek verse—we
have only twenty or thirty lines of Homer translated
by Tennyson, and a few lines of other Greek poets translated
by equally able men, which are at all satisfactory.
Under all circumstances take a prose translation when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
wish to study a Greek or Latin author. We should of course
consider Homer first. I do not think that you can afford
not to read something of Homer. There are two excellent
prose translations in English, one of the Iliad and one of the
Odyssey. The latter is for you the more important of the
two great poems. The references to it are innumerable in
all branches of literature; and these references refer usually
to the poetry of its theme, for the Odyssey is much more a
romance than is the Iliad. The advantage of the prose
translation by Lang and Butcher is that it preserves something
of the rolling sound and music of the Greek verse,
though it is only prose. That book I should certainly consider
worth keeping constantly by you; its utility will appear
to you at a later day. The great Greek tragedies have
all been translated; but I should not so strongly recommend
these translations to you. It would be just as well, in most
cases, to familiarize yourselves with the stories of the dramas
through other sources; and there are hundreds of these.
You should at least know the subject of the great dramas
of Sophocles, Æschylus, and above all Euripides. Greek
drama was constructed upon a plan that requires much
study to understand correctly; it is not necessary that you
should understand these matters as an antiquarian does,
but it is necessary to know something of the stories of the
great plays. As for comedy, the works of Aristophanes are
quite exceptional in their value and interest. They require
very little explanation; they make us laugh to-day just as
heartily as they made the Athenians laugh thousands of
years ago; and they belong to immortal literature. There
is the Bohn translation in two volumes, which I would
strongly recommend. Aristophanes is one of the great
Greek dramatists whom we can read over and over again,
gaining at every reading. Of the lyrical poets there is also
one translation likely to become an English classic, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
a modern one; that is Lang’s translation of Theocritus, a
tiny little book, but very precious of its kind. You see I am
mentioning very few; but these few would mean a great
deal for you, should you use them properly. Among later
Greek work, work done in the decline of the old civilization,
there is one masterpiece that the world will never become
tired of—I mentioned it before, the story of <cite>Daphnis and
Chloe</cite>. This has been translated into every language, and I
am sorry to say that the best translation is not English, but
French—the version of Amyot. But there are many English
translations. That book you certainly ought to read.
About the Latin authors, it is not here necessary to say
much. There are very good prose translations of Virgil and
Horace, but the value of these to you cannot be very great
without a knowledge of Latin. However, the story of the
Æneid is necessary to know, and it were best read in the
version of Conington. In the course of your general education
it is impossible to avoid learning something regarding
the chief Latin writers and thinkers; but there is one immortal
book that you may not have often seen the name of; and
it is a book everybody should read—I mean the <cite>Golden
Ass</cite> of Apuleius. You have this in a good English translation.
It is only a story of sorcery, but one of the most wonderful
stories ever written, and it belongs to world literature
rather than to the literature of a time.</p>

<p>But the Greek myths, although eternally imperishable
in their beauty, are not more intimately related to English
literature than are the myths of the ancient English religion,
the religion of the Northern races, which has left its echoes
all through our forms of speech, even in the names of the
days of the week. A student of English literature ought to
know something about Northern mythology. It is full of
beauty also, beauty of another and stranger kind; and it embodies
one of the noblest warrior-faiths that ever existed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the religion of force and courage. You have now in the library
a complete collection of Northern poetry, I mean the
two volumes of the <cite>Corpus Poeticum Boreali</cite>. Unfortunately
you have not as yet a good collection of the Sagas and Eddas.
But, as in the case of the vaster subject of Greek mythology,
there is an excellent small book in English, giving an
outline of all that is important—I mean necessary for you—in
regard to both the religion and the literature of the
Northern races, Mallet’s <cite>Northern Antiquities</cite>. Sir Walter
Scott contributed the most valuable portion of the translations
in this little book; and these translations have stood
the test of time remarkably well. The introductory chapters
by Bishop Percy are old-fashioned, but this fact does
not in the least diminish the stirring value of the volume. I
think it is one of the books that every student should try to
possess.</p>

<p>With regard to the great modern masterpieces translated
into English from other tongues, I can only say that it is
better to read them in the originals, if you can. If you can
read Goethe’s <cite>Faust</cite> in German, do not read it in English;
and if you can read Heine in German, the French translation
in prose, which he superintended, and the English
translations (there are many of them) in verse can be of no
use to you. But if German be too difficult, then read <cite>Faust</cite>
in the prose version of Hayward, as revised by Dr. Buchheim.
You have that in the library; and it is the best of the
kind in existence. <cite>Faust</cite> is a book that a man should buy
and keep, and read many times during his life. As for
Heine, he is a world poet, but he loses a great deal in translation;
and I can only recommend the French prose version
of him; the English versions of Browning and Lazarus and
others are often weak. Some years ago a series of extraordinary
translations of Heine appeared in <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite>;
but these have not appeared, I believe, in book form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>As for Dante, I do not know whether he can make a
strong appeal to you in any language except his own; and
you must understand the Middle Ages very well to feel
how wonderful he was. I might say something similar about
other great Italian poets. Of the French dramatists, you
must study Molière; he is next in importance only to Shakespeare.
But do not read him in any translation. Here I
should say positively, that one who cannot read French
might as well leave Molière alone; the English language
cannot reproduce his delicacies of wit and allusion.</p>

<p>As for modern English literature, I have tried in the
course of my lectures to indicate the few books deserving of
a place in world-literature; and I need scarcely repeat them
here. Going back a little further, however, I should like to
remind you again of the extraordinary merit of Malory’s
book the <cite>Morte d’Arthur</cite>, and to say that it is one of the
very few that you should buy and keep and read often. The
whole spirit of chivalry is in that book; and I need scarcely
tell you how deep is the relation of the spirit of chivalry to
all modern English literature. I do not recommend you to
read Milton, unless you intend to make certain special studies
of language; the linguistic value of Milton is based
upon Greek and Latin literature. As for his lyrics—that is
another matter. Those ought to be studied. As there is little
more to say, except by way of suggestion, I think that
you ought, every one of you, to have a good copy of Shakespeare,
and to read Shakespeare through once every year,
not caring at first whether you can understand all the sentences
or not; that knowledge can be acquired at a later day.
I am sure that if you follow this advice you will find Shakespeare
become larger every time that you read him, and
that at last he will begin to exercise a very strong and very
healthy influence upon your methods of thinking and feeling.
A man does not require to be a great scholar in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
read Shakespeare. And what is true of reading Shakespeare,
you will find to be true also in lesser degree of all the world’s
great books. You will find it true of Goethe’s <cite>Faust</cite>. You
will find it true of the best chapters in the poems of Homer.
You will find it true of the best plays of Molière. You will
find it true of Dante, and of those books in the English Bible
about which I gave a short lecture last year. And therefore
I do not think that I can better conclude these remarks
than by repeating an old but very excellent piece of advice
which has been given to young readers: “Whenever you
hear of a new book being published, read an old one.”</p>
